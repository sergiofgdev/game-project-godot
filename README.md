"Pesadilla en el instituto" is my final project for my Certificate of Higher Education in Multiplatform Application Development. It's also my first venture into game development and a new way to test and learn new languages and tools.

Short, but made with love and many hours of learning.

In this small demo, in the purest style of The Legend of Zelda, we take control of a boy in his high school who tries to find his friends while killing the viruses he encounters along the way.

Made during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.


You can play the videogame in [itch.io](https://sergiofgdev.itch.io/pesadilla-en-el-instituto) y pod√©is leer la
